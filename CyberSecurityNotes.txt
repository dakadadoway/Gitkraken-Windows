-Hardware----->firmware---->Binary Input Output Systems (BIOS)----> (OS-operating system- starts here) Kernal ---->Shell---->File system 

-Binary is also known as “Machine language” and assembly code is a level above “machine language” 

-base layer of programming that exists on every hardware 

-BIOS is the firmware for the mother board, its main job is to check if everything is working
correctly and if not, it will alert. (makes sure everything's turned on) 

Kernal determines the style/architecture of the operating system based on what it's used for.
 Also passes information(messenger/translator) 

-Operating systems: IOS, android, Linux, cisco, Debian, ubuntu, windows, iMac, etc. 
(1000-1200+ system operators) 

-Kali Linux is used for exploitation tools, forensic tools, hardware hacking, information 
gathering, password cracking, reverse engineering, wireless attacks, web applications, 
stress testing, sniffing and spoofing, vulnerability analysis, and many more 


=================================What is bash scripting?==============================

Bash scripting involves writing a series of commands in a plain text file (called a script)
that the Bash interpreter can execute. This allows you to automate tasks, manage system
operations, and perform complex sequences of actions with just a single command.

-------------Basic Components of a Bash Script
Shebang (#!) Line:

The first line in a script that tells the system which interpreter to use.
Example:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
Commands:

The actual instructions you want the script to perform.
Example:
bash
Copy code
echo "Hello, World!"
Comments:

Lines that start with # and are not executed. They help explain the script.
Example:
bash
Copy code
# This is a comment
