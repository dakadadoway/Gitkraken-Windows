-BIOS is the firmware for the mother board, its main job is to check if everything is working
correctly and if not, it will alert. (makes sure everything's turned on) 

Kernal determines the style/architecture of the operating system based on what it's used for.
 Also passes information(messenger/translator)

=================================What is bash scripting?==============================

Bash scripting involves writing a series of commands in a plain text file (called a script)
that the Bash interpreter can execute. This allows you to automate tasks, manage system
operations, and perform complex sequences of actions with just a single command.

-------------Basic Components of a Bash Script
Shebang (#!) Line:

The first line in a script that tells the system which interpreter to use. here are some examples
Example:
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
Commands:

The actual instructions you want the script to perform.
Example:
bash
Copy code
echo "Hello, World!"
Comments:

Lines that start with # and are not executed. They help explain the script.
Example:
bash
Copy code
# This is a comment

 Common Bash Commands:
echo: Prints text to the terminal.
Example: echo "Hello, World!" displays Hello, World! on the screen.
cd: Changes the current directory.
Example: cd /home/user/Documents changes to the Documents directory.
ls: Lists files and directories.
Example: ls -l lists files with details like permissions and size.
touch: Creates an empty file.
Example: touch file.txt creates a file named file.txt.
chmod: Changes file permissions.
Example: chmod +x script.sh makes script.sh executable.
if, for, while: Conditional and loop structures for decision-making and iteration.
Example: if [ -f file.txt ]; then echo "File exists"; fi checks if file.txt exists and prints a message.


 How to Write a Bash Script:
Step 1: Create a new file with the .sh extension.
Example: touch myscript.sh
Step 2: Open the file in a text editor (e.g., nano myscript.sh) and start with the shebang line:
#!/bin/bash
This tells the system to use the Bash interpreter to execute the script.

Bash Scripting: Research and Notes
1. Definition: What is a Bash script? What are its uses in Linux?
-Bash Script: A Bash script is a plain text file containing a series of commands written in the Bash (Bourne Again Shell) language. It’s a scripting language used for automating tasks in Linux and Unix-based systems.
-Uses in Linux:
    Automating repetitive tasks
    Running system maintenance
    Managing files and directories
    Running scripts at specific times using cron jobs
    Configuring environments and handling backups

2. Basic Syntax: How to write a simple Bash script
-Creating a Basic Script
    1.Start the script with the shebang line to indicate the script should be run with Bash:

        #!/bin/bash
    2.Write the commands you want to execute line by line.
        -Using Variables:
        Syntax:

        VAR_NAME=value
        echo $VAR_NAME
        
        -Example:

        #!/bin/bash
        NAME="Student"
        echo "Hello, $NAME!"
        
        -Control Structures:
        1.if-else statement:

        if [ condition ]; then
        # Code to execute if condition is true
        else
        # Code to execute if condition is false
        fi  
        
        -Example:

        #!/bin/bash
        number=5
        if [ $number -gt 0 ]; then
        echo "Number is positive"
        else
        echo "Number is negative"
        fi
        
        2.for loop:

        for var in item1 item2 item3; do
            # Commands to execute for each item
        done
        
        -Example:

        #!/bin/bash
        for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
            echo "Number: $i"
        done
        
        3.while loop:

        while [ condition ]; do
            # Code to execute while the condition is true
        done
        
        -Example:

        #!/bin/bash
        count=1
        while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
            echo "Count: $count"
            ((count++))
        done

3. Key Bash Commands and How They Work in Scripts
echo: Prints text or variables to the screen.


echo "Hello, World!"
echo "My name is $NAME"
read: Takes user input and assigns it to a variable.


read -p "Enter your name: " USERNAME
echo "Welcome, $USERNAME"
touch: Creates an empty file if it doesn't exist.


touch myfile.txt
mkdir: Creates a directory.


mkdir my_directory
if: Checks conditions and executes code based on true/false outcomes.


if [ condition ]; then
    # do something
fi
4. Self-Made Instructions: Test Script Example
Task: Create a script that checks if a directory exists, and if not, creates it.
Script:


#!/bin/bash
# Check if directory exists, create it if it doesn't

DIRECTORY="myfolder"

if [ -d "$DIRECTORY" ]; then
    echo "Directory $DIRECTORY already exists."
else
    echo "Directory $DIRECTORY does not exist. Creating now..."
    mkdir $DIRECTORY
    echo "Directory $DIRECTORY created."
fi
How it works:

-d: Checks if the directory exists.
If the directory does not exist, it will create it using mkdir.
